## 📋 Overview

This repository serves as a **technical and academic sandbox** to explore the concept of a stablecoin pegged to the Venezuelan Bolivar (VES/Bs.). Inspired by public discussions on the feasibility of decentralized financial tools in emerging economies, this project aims to prototype, analyze, and document potential architectures without political affiliation or immediate commercial intent.

### 🎯 Objectives

1.  **Feasibility Analysis**: Evaluate technical, economic, and legal challenges.
2.  **Architecture Prototyping**: Design and simulate issuance/redemption flows on blockchain networks (L2s, Solana, etc.).
3.  **Transparency**: Promote open discussion about decentralized finance in Venezuela.

## 🛠️ Components

- **`/research`**: Economic models, legal feasibility studies, and conversation analysis.
- **`/architecture`**: System design, flow diagrams (Mermaid), and stack selection.
- **`/prototypes`**: Proof-of-concept smart contracts and interaction scripts.
